# amazon-review-scores
Herein I created a MongoDB database called "amazon" that reads a select number of amazon reviews, each of them as a separate document, to the collection "reviews"  in the database "amazon".  Then I used MongoDB's map reduce function to build a new collection "avg_scores" that averages review scores by product ("asin") and subsequently a new collection called "weighted_avg_scores" that averages review scores by product ("asin"), weighted by the number of helpful votes. To average review scores based on weightage I used the base weight as 1 and for every additional helpful vote added 1 to the weight.
